# Bulk Page Adder for WordPress

## Description
The Bulk Page Adder plugin allows WordPress administrators to create multiple pages at once directly from the WordPress admin panel. By entering page titles in a textarea, administrators can quickly generate new pages with empty content.

## Features
**Easy Page Creation**: Enter page titles in a textarea, one per line, and create them with a single button click.
**Feedback Notifications**: Receive success or error messages after attempting to create pages.
**Clear Input**: The textarea is cleared after pages are created to prevent accidental re-creation.

## Installation
1. Download the plugin from the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/HridoyVaraby/bulk-page-adder).
2. Upload the `bulk-page-adder` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory in your WordPress installation.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
4. Navigate to the 'Bulk Page Adder' menu item in the admin panel.
5. Enter the desired page titles in the textarea and click the 'Create Pages' button.

Usage
**Page Titles**: Enter each page title on a new line in the textarea.
**Create Pages**: Click the 'Create Pages' button to create the pages.
**Feedback**: Success or error messages will be displayed below the button.
